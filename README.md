## Key Feature & Constraints
This project was a coding challenge assigned at Imperial College London. The challenge resembles [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) but with a set of extra challenges and twists designed to test our ability to code in an object-oriented manner.
